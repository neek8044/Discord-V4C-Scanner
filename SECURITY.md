### API Supported Versions

:x: Not supported

:white_check_mark: Supported by main_multiapi.py

:heavy_check_mark: Supported by both scripts

| API Version | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| v5 and below | :x: |
| v6   | :white_check_mark: |
| v7   | :white_check_mark: |
| v8   | :white_check_mark: |
| v9   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| v10 and above | :x: |

### API Updates

For now I am manually updating the API versions. I *may* add something to auto check for new ones and use them but currently there is no such option (18/March/2023). You can manually go in the script and change API_VER to your desired version.

# Quick Note
I am *not responsible* if your discord account gets deactivated, banned, or anything similar. **Use this AT YOUR OWN RISK**, preferably with a VPN so the Discord devs wont be able to see where the requests are coming from.
